    "This dataset is about distinguishing genuine and forged banknotes. Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400 x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object, gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. A Wavelet Transform tool was used to extract features from these images. The input and the output attributes are as follows:\n",
